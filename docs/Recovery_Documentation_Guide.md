# Recovery Documentation Guide

## Which docs should I follow?

For Recovery UX behavior, implementation rules, and acceptance criteria, follow **docs/recovery**:

- [recovery/TinyTorrent_Recovery_UX_Specification.md](recovery/TinyTorrent_Recovery_UX_Specification.md)
- [recovery/Recovery UX — Final Acceptance Specification (Post-Implementation).md](recovery/Recovery%20UX%20%E2%80%94%20Final%20Acceptance%20Specification%20(Post-Implementation).md)
- [recovery/Recovery UX — Engineer Checklist.md](recovery/Recovery%20UX%20%E2%80%94%20Engineer%20Checklist.md)

## What is in `docs/bug fixing/`?

`docs/bug fixing/` recovery files are historical implementation artifacts and investigation notes.
They are useful for context, but they are not authoritative contracts.

Archive index:

- [bug fixing/Recovery_Docs_Archive_Index.md](bug%20fixing/Recovery_Docs_Archive_Index.md)

## Practical rule

- **Build/change behavior**: follow `docs/recovery`.
- **Investigate history/context**: use `docs/bug fixing/`.
