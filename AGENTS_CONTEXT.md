# **AGENTS_CONTEXT.md — TinyTorrent Constitution**

This document explains **why** the CORE exists.
It informs judgment but does **not** override law.

---

## **1. Product Identity**

TinyTorrent is:

* Modern µTorrent successor
* Glass / acrylic workbench
* VS Code–style command center
* Dark-first, premium, confident

Not:

* Compact
* Web-first
* Minimalist
* “Data dense by shrinking UI”

Density comes from **information design**, not small buttons.

---

## **2. Design North Star**

> *Does this feel more powerful, confident, and authoritative?*

If the answer is:

* “It saves space” → reject
* “It looks compact” → reject
* “It feels premium and deliberate” → accept

---

## **3. Desktop Tool Philosophy**

TinyTorrent behaves like:

* An IDE
* A DAW
* A professional control surface

It does **not** behave like:

* A webpage
* A mobile app
* A responsive dashboard

---

## **4. Motion as Structure**

Motion exists to:

* Explain hierarchy
* Preserve continuity
* Show causality

Never for decoration.

Lists glide.
Selections ease.
Reorders animate.
Nothing jumps.

---

## **5. Workbench Mental Model**

* Parts → Containers → Panes → Views
* Panes persist
* Views swap
* State continuity is sacred

This prevents:

* Scroll loss
* Focus loss
* “Web app flicker”

---

## **6. Why Tokens Are Law**

Tokens:

* Make scaling deterministic
* Prevent visual drift
* Allow global tuning
* Enforce consistency without micromanagement

Literal numbers destroy all of that.

---

## **7. Why Redundancy Exists**

Rules repeat because:

* Agents forget
* Context changes
* Drift is subtle

Redundancy is intentional.

---

## **8. Agent Role Expectation**

Agents are:

* Tool UI engineers
* System designers
* Constraint followers

Agents are not:

* Designers “experimenting”
* Optimizers shaving pixels
* Web developers imposing browser limits

---

## **9. Evolution Rule**

Changes must:

* Increase clarity
* Reduce ambiguity
* Strengthen invariants

If a change adds flexibility but weakens guarantees, it is rejected.

---

## **10. Final Reminder**

TinyTorrent must:

* Behave like a native desktop tool
* Look better than any desktop tool
* Remain small, fast, and precise

If forced to choose:

* **Correctness > Cleverness**
* **Determinism > Convenience**
* **Authority > Compactness**
