2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for
sale, having made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or
any Combination in which its Contributions are made by such Contributor
to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise
transfer either its Contributions or such Combination.

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are subject to the following
condition and limitation.

2.2. Contributor's Patent License to You

If You bring a patent infringement claim against a Contributor with respect
to a patent Licensable by such Contributor, then the patent licenses granted
by that Contributor to You under this License for that Contributor's
Contributions shall terminate as of the date such claim is filed.

2.3. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You make or to which You contribute, must be under the
terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how to
obtain a copy of this License. You may not offer or impose any terms on any
one that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
rights granted hereunder to a recipient of Covered Software in Source Code
Form.

2.4. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
as described in Section 2.3, and you must inform recipients of the
Executable Form how to obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of
distribution to the recipient; and

(b) you may distribute the Executable Form under the terms of this License,
or sublicense the Executable Form under different terms provided that the
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

2.5. Larger Works

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of your choice, so
long as You do not attempt to limit the rights of the recipients of the
Larger Work over the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is distributed as
source code, then the Source Code Form of the Covered Software must be
distributed under this License; if the Larger Work is distributed only in
Executable Form, the Covered Software in Executable Form must be made
available under the terms of Section 2.4.

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Required Notices

You must keep intact all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
notices that are present in the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
except that You may substitute a notice that references this License and the
location of its text. You may add your own copyright statement to your
Modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of your Modifications, or
for any such Covered Software as incorporated into a Larger Work, provided
that any such additional or different license terms and conditions do not
apply to the Covered Software itself, and do not restrict the recipients'
rights under this License for the Source Code Form of the Covered Software.

3.2. Distribution of Source Code Form

You may distribute the Source Code Form of Covered Software under the
terms of this License.

3.3. Secondary Licenses

Notwithstanding Section 3.1, a Contributor may choose to make Covered
Software available under a Secondary License. If a Contributor does so, the
Secondary License will be identified in the notice described in Exhibit B.
If the Covered Software is made available under a Secondary License, You may
use the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or the
Secondary License, but not both.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file sent
with the Covered Software, and in a prominent location on any website where
you make the Covered Software available for download.

5. Termination

5.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms hereof and do not cure such
failure in 30 days after becoming aware of the failure. However,
termination does not terminate licenses granted by any third party who may
have received Covered Software from You under this License.

5.2. Sections 2.2, 3.1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 survive any termination of this
License.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.

7. Limitation of Liability

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, will
any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the
use or inability to use the Covered Software (including but not limited to
loss of data, business, or profits), even if such Contributor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

8. Attribution

You must not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, or attribution
notices contained within the Covered Software, including the notices in
Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any litigation relating to this License shall be governed by
the substantive laws of the jurisdiction where the initial Contributor
resides, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
