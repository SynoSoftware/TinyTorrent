## 🧠 Motivation

I grew up with torrent clients that were **~160 KB** — small, fast, and engineered with real hardware limits in mind. That era is gone. Today even a simple tray application wastes memory it has no reason to touch, and I’m not fine with that. So I decided to do something about it.

My first idea was a pure C, bare-metal Windows client — no external libraries, just raw WinAPI. The UI was unacceptable, so I abandoned that approach. Later I realized that every modern system already ships with a fully optimized, GPU-accelerated rendering engine: the web browser. Used _on demand_, it delivers better visuals, less UI code, and zero idle UI memory.

This project exists to bring back what made the classics great: a lean core, a tiny binary, and a UI that feels modern — without abandoning engineering discipline.

**This is how TinyTorrent was born.**

Instead of dragging UI toolkits into the binary, TinyTorrent is split cleanly:

- **Native Tray Daemon:**  
  A minimal C/C++ executable responsible for lifecycle, tray controls (pause/resume/open GUI), and the torrent engine. Always running. No UI.

- **On-Demand GUI:**  
  A browser-based UI launched only when requested (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).  
  When closed, **no UI process exists**.

**Zero GUI memory when unused.**  
Exactly how it should be.

## 💎 Key Features

### Browser-Native HUD (frontend/)

- **Zero GUI memory when unused** — the interface is launched on demand in an external browser.
- **Glass Monolith UI** — Tailwind v4 + HeroUI + blur + depth for a stealth aesthetic.
- **Workspace Components**
  - **File Explorer Tree:** Nested, accordion-style file selection with priority toggling.
  - **Visualizers:** Real-time speed graphs, Disk Space Gauge, and peer maps.
- **Kinetic Motion** — Framer Motion used for structural transitions, not decoration.

### Backend-Agnostic Architecture

TinyTorrent is not tied to a single engine.

- **Strict RPC boundary:** The UI talks to a well-defined API.
- **Adapter Pattern:**
  - **Transmission Adapter:** Uses standard Transmission RPC.
  - **Libtorrent Adapter:** Planned C++ wrapper around `libtorrent-rasterbar`.

### Interaction Model

- **Queue Management:** Reorder torrents, move to top/bottom, drag-and-drop.
- **Deep Interaction:** Shift-click ranges, Ctrl-click toggles, full keyboard navigation.
- **Exact Typing:** No `any`. RPC schema is strictly typed and normalized.

## ⚖️ Licensing Rationale

TinyTorrent is licensed under **MPL-2.0** for the code because I want this project to stay true to the spirit that in my eyes made uTorrent great (small, practical, user-respecting), and to avoid the “uTorrent way” where a great tool drifts into a closed, adware/bloat-heavy direction.

MPL-2.0 is a pragmatic middle ground: it keeps the project open and encourages improvements to flow back when code is modified and redistributed, while still being compatible with real-world integration.

Notes:

- Repository license texts live at the repo root: `LICENSE` (MPL-2.0) and `APACHE-2.0`.
- Protocol/spec docs are **Apache-2.0**; branding assets are **proprietary/trademarked** (see the notices adjacent to those assets).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- **Development:** You can run the frontend against a standard `transmission-daemon` (port 9091).

### Development (frontend)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** The root and backend directories are intentionally TypeScript/Node-free. All `npm`/`npx` work happens inside `frontend/` so the native build tree stays clean. See `AGENTS.md` for the full rule set.

### Development (backend)

#### Generate a Visual Studio solution (Windows)

From a fresh clone, you can generate a `.sln` using Meson’s Visual Studio backend via the PowerShell helper:

```powershell
cd backend
./make.ps1 vs Debug
```

This produces the solution at:

- `backend/build_vs/debug/tinytorrent-daemon.sln`

For a release solution:

```powershell
cd backend
./make.ps1 vs Release
```

Output:

- `backend/build_vs/release/tinytorrent-daemon.sln`

Notes:

- The script also writes Visual Studio `.vcxproj.user` debug settings so the debugger can find required runtime DLLs (vcpkg deps and ASan runtime in Debug).
- If you change toolsets / vcpkg triplets / upgrade Visual Studio, rerun `./make.ps1 vs Debug` to regenerate those settings.

## Backend Note

Today, the only backend that is working reliably end-to-end is a standard **`transmission-daemon`**.

In parallel, we’re building a **TinyTorrent-native daemon** (currently WIP) built around **libtorrent (C++)**. This path is the main reason our current executable misses the original size target: libtorrent (and the surrounding C++ runtime + dependencies) is heavier than a minimal Transmission-based setup.

Why go this way anyway? Because the Transmission-based setup has had reliability issues for our use case — most notably around **starting magnet downloads immediately** (and, in some cases, entering unrecoverable wait states). The libtorrent-based daemon is intended to solve those problems while keeping a clean RPC boundary.

Current priorities are correctness and stability first; optimization comes later. We may be able to shave some size off, but a dramatic drop is unlikely while we stay on libtorrent + C++.

The often-mentioned **~1 MB** number is an _optimistic_ outcome for a Transmission-based/minimal build path; it’s not the only metric we optimize for while the libtorrent daemon is being stabilized.

Longer-term (time permitting): once the libtorrent-based daemon is solid, we may take on Transmission itself and apply a similar approach there. There’s also an aspirational “classic uTorrent” goal: potentially rewriting more of the stack in **C** with an aggressive size target (roughly **1–1.5 MB UPX-packed**), primarily as an engineering challenge.

- `docs/TinyTorrent_Specification.md`

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Defined in **AGENTS.md** (root). That document also makes the rule explicit: only `frontend/` owns TypeScript and Node tooling, keeping the rest of the tree purely native.

1. Speed
2. Density
3. One Responsibility
4. Exact Typing
5. No entropy in the codebase

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests must follow the **Visual Excellence Directive**:

- Modern and consistent components
- Framer Motion for structural transitions
- Strict TypeScript
- No regressions in performance
