[x] 1. high - Remove RPC extensions - Delete *all* TinyTorrent extension scaffolding so the UI talks to `transmission-daemon` via vanilla Transmission RPC only: remove `tt-get-capabilities`, websocket/delta-sync session code, `X-TT-Auth` token handling, `session-ui-attach/detach`, and any TinyTorrent-only RPC method surface; ensure build has no references to these methods/headers/features and that polling is the only sync model - src/services/rpc/rpc-base.ts, src/services/rpc/*
[x] 2. high - Remove TT token plumbing - Remove `token` from connection profiles and delete any sessionStorage writes/reads for `tt-auth-token` plus any `NativeShell.onEvent("auth-token")` consumers; after this, only Transmission username/password are used for auth and remote profile switching - src/app/providers/TorrentClientProvider.tsx, src/app/context/ConnectionConfigContext.tsx
[x] 3. high - ShellAgent/ShellExtensions adapter - Create a single adapter (interface + implementation) that owns *all* ShellExtensions bridge calls/events in one place (for review + AI safety), and refactor call sites to import the adapter/provider instead of importing `NativeShell` directly. Required surface (minimum): `browseDirectory/openFolderDialog`, `openFileDialog`, `openPath`, `sendWindowCommand`, `getSystemIntegrationStatus`, `setSystemIntegration`, `request("persist-window-state")`, and event `magnet-link`. Explicitly remove/avoid `auth-token` (Transmission-only). Adapter must enforce locality rules by consuming `uiMode` (no-op/unsupported outcomes when `uiMode="Rpc"`). IMPORTANT: `checkFreeSpace` must NOT be a ShellExtensions call; Transmission RPC already exposes free-space and that is the only supported source of truth. If we keep "install/registration/handlers" features, they must also move behind this adapter (and be removed from `src/services/rpc/*`). - src/app/runtime.ts, src/app/hooks/useOpenTorrentFolder.ts, src/app/hooks/useAddModalState.ts, src/app/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/SettingsModal.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/tabs/system/SystemTabContent.tsx, src/app/orchestrators/useTorrentOrchestrator.ts, src/app/App.tsx
[x] 4. high - Capability helper (locality) - Implement a shared helper that computes UI mode/capabilities from (a) endpoint host (loopback vs remote) and (b) ShellAgent/ShellExtensions bridge availability; deprecate `serverClass`/`ServerType`/`connectionMode` for UI decisions; introduce `UiMode = "Full" | "Rpc"` and a UI-level capability model; replace `ServerCapabilities` with `UiMode/UiCapabilities` - src/services/rpc/engine-adapter.ts, src/app/context/ConnectionConfigContext.tsx, src/app/context/LifecycleContext.tsx, src/app/context/RecoveryContext.tsx
[x] 5. medium - Capability contract tests - Add tests verifying the capability helper: loopback+shell => ShellExtensions enabled; loopback+no-shell => manual only; remote/browser => no shell features; ensure no UI path calls the ShellAgent adapter when `uiMode="Rpc"` - tests (new), src/services/rpc/engine-adapter.ts
[x] 6. high - Settings UI: Transmission + UiMode only - Update SettingsModal + Connection/System tabs to remove "TinyTorrent server" language, extension cards, websocket transport mentions, and token/security protocol UI. Settings must consume `UiMode = "Full" | "Rpc"` and render ShellExtensions features only when `uiMode="Full"`; remote/browser must show disabled controls + explicit explanation. - src/modules/settings/components/SettingsModal.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/tabs/connection/ConnectionTabContent.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/tabs/connection/ConnectionManager.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/tabs/system/SystemTabContent.tsx, src/i18n/en.json
[x] 7. high - Session + UiMode provider - Introduce a single provider that exposes `rpcStatus`, `sessionStats`, and `uiMode = "Full" | "Rpc"` (derived from endpoint locality + ShellAgent/ShellExtensions bridge availability); refactor StatusBar/Settings/AppShell to consume this provider and stop passing `serverClass/connectionMode/engineType` around - src/app/App.tsx, src/app/components/layout/StatusBar.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/SettingsModal.tsx, src/app/context/LifecycleContext.tsx, src/app/context/RecoveryContext.tsx
[x] 7a. medium - UiMode naming + translation cleanup - Standardize user-facing naming: `uiMode="Full"` maps to "TinyTorrent" and `uiMode="Rpc"` maps to "Transmission"; delete `connection_mode_tinytorrent_*` and "TinyTorrent server type" strings once uiMode replaces serverClass/connectionMode; ensure all UX copy matches the simplified mental model - src/i18n/en.json, src/app/components/layout/StatusBar.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/tabs/connection/ConnectionManager.tsx, src/app/utils/setLocation.ts
[x] 8. medium - Remove websocket UX surfaces - Remove websocket/delta-sync references in UI labels/types (StatusBar transport status, HeartbeatSource variants, websocket translation keys) so transport is described as polling-only; keep refresh intervals/telemetry provider as the single scheduling authority - src/services/rpc/heartbeat.ts, src/app/components/layout/StatusBar.tsx, src/i18n/en.json
[x] 8a. medium - Remove ShellExtensions "check-free-space" bridge - Delete the `check-free-space` IPC/NativeShell method and all callers; ensure `checkFreeSpace` in the UI is always `EngineAdapter.checkFreeSpace()` (Transmission RPC `free-space`) and document that it returns *daemon-side* disk space (remote daemon => remote disk) - src/app/runtime.ts, src/services/rpc/rpc-base.ts, src/modules/torrent-add/components/AddTorrentModal.tsx, src/services/recovery/recovery-controller.ts
[x] 9. high - Single recovery gate - Choose one recovery gate implementation and delete the other: all recovery entry points call the same `requestRecovery` and receive the same promise (dedupe by torrent fingerprint/id); UI components do not run recovery sequences directly - src/app/context/RecoveryGateContext.tsx, src/app/orchestrators/useTorrentOrchestrator.ts, src/modules/dashboard/hooks/useRecoveryController.ts
[x] 10. high - Recovery UX spec compliance - Update recovery controller/gate to emit deterministic `{state, confidence, recommendedActions}` for S1-S4 and enforce Retry=probe-only; UI copy must follow confidence rules (unknown => "Location unavailable"); verify sequencing rules (verify vs skip) are encoded once in the controller - src/services/recovery/*, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentRecoveryModal.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentDetails_General.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentTable_RowMenu.tsx
[x] 11. medium - Set-location flow split - Refactor set-location into two explicit flows: (A) browse (rendered only when uiMode="Full"; not rendered at all in uiMode="Rpc"), (B) manual input (always available unless explicitly disabled); manage manual editor state via reducer `{draft,status,error}`; keep editor/modal open until gate resolves; Host-backed UI elements must be absent, not disabled, when unavailable; remove scattered owner/outcome maps and derive conflict states - src/app/orchestrators/useTorrentOrchestrator.ts, src/modules/dashboard/components/SetLocationInlineEditor.tsx  
[x] 12. medium - Recovery display from gate - Remove recovery display derivation from `errorEnvelope` formatting in table/status/header; display should render only from gate-provided {state, confidence} (no inference from raw errors) and show the correct primary action hint; Host-backed UI elements must be absent, not disabled, when unavailable; keep formatting utilities but make them accept gate state not raw envelope - src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentTable_ColumnDefs.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentDetails_Header.tsx, src/shared/utils/recoveryFormat.ts
[x] 13. high - ViewModel contracts + prop consolidation - Split AppContent into: (1) `useAppViewModel()` (or provider) that wires selection/actions/recovery/settings/session + produces a small, grouped UI model, and (2) presentational Views (WorkspaceShell/Dashboard/StatusBar/Settings/Recovery/Navbar/Table) that render from ViewModel outputs only; explicitly replace "dozens of props" with `WorkspaceShellViewModel` + `DashboardViewModel` + `NavbarViewModel` + `TorrentTableViewModel` contracts and document ownership rules (Views render only; ViewModels/orchestrators sequence/derive; adapters do IO) - src/app/App.tsx, src/app/components/WorkspaceShell.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/Dashboard_Layout.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentTable.tsx, src/app/components/layout/StatusBar.tsx, src/app/components/layout/Navbar.tsx, src/modules/settings/components/SettingsModal.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentRecoveryModal.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentTable_RowMenu.tsx, src/shared/ui/workspace/FileExplorerTree.tsx
[ ] 14. medium - Unify action gate + workflows - Remove separate UIActionGate context or fold it into view-model; centralize "removed" state and selection-aware workflow decisions in one place so optimistic UI and delete/resume flows are not spread across contexts/hooks - src/app/context/UIActionGateContext.tsx, src/app/hooks/useTorrentWorkflow.ts, src/app/context/SelectionContext.tsx
[ ] 15. medium - Preferences provider - Centralize all UI-only preferences behind one provider (explicit schema + migrations): refresh interval, request timeout, table watermark, workbench scale, workspace style, HUD dismissed cards, theme, and language. Leaf hooks/components must not read/write localStorage directly; they consume `usePreferences()` instead - src/app/hooks/useSettingsFlow.ts, src/app/hooks/useWorkbenchScale.ts, src/app/hooks/useWorkspaceShell.ts, src/shared/utils/theme.ts, src/i18n/index.ts, src/shared/ui/controls/LanguageMenu.tsx, src/modules/dashboard/hooks/useTorrentTablePersistence.ts, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentDetails_Speed_Chart.tsx, src/modules/settings/*
[ ] 16. low - Command registry + hotkeys - Create a command registry that defines commands (id, group, title, description, shortcuts) once; CommandPalette and GlobalHotkeysHost consume it; remove duplicated hotkey registration in AppContent/GlobalHotkeysHost - src/app/components/CommandPalette.tsx, src/app/components/GlobalHotkeysHost.tsx, src/app/App.tsx
[ ] 17. medium - Add-torrent defaults service - Extract add-torrent defaults (last download dir, start/paused) into a dedicated service/hook; AddTorrentModal becomes a pure form that receives values/handlers; orchestrator owns persistence - src/app/orchestrators/useTorrentOrchestrator.ts, src/modules/torrent-add/components/AddTorrentModal.tsx
[ ] 18. low - Deprecate RPC-extended docs - Mark RPC-extended documentation as historical and prevent it from being treated as active guidance; ensure engineers follow `docs/EXE architecutre.md` (Transmission RPC only) - docs/TinyTorrent_RPC_Extended.md, docs/TinyTorrent_Specification.md
[ ] 19. medium - Unify timers/scheduling authority - Inventory and consolidate background polling timers (heartbeat refresh, UiClock tick, recovery modal timers, orchestrator probes) behind one scheduler/provider so engineers don’t add “just one more interval”; document what runs when the UI is open and how it scales with list size - src/services/rpc/heartbeat.ts, src/shared/hooks/useUiClock.ts, src/app/orchestrators/useTorrentOrchestrator.ts, src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentRecoveryModal.tsx
[ ] 20. low - Consolidate ad-hoc window events/debug hooks - Replace stringly-typed `CustomEvent` names and module-scope `window.__*` debug helpers with a centralized `events.ts`/debug module; ensure dev-only helpers cannot ship/affect prod behavior - src/modules/dashboard/components/TorrentDetails_Pieces_Map.tsx, src/app/hooks/useWorkbenchScale.ts
